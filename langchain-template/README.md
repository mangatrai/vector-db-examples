watched few langchain templates videos.
really powerful stuff. i was able to get start and deploy some basic RAG application in less than 10 minutes. this is to put developers on fast track of development.
using it was easy. i tried with couple of examples pirate-speak and astradb entomology.
overall really powerful, easy to use, bringing speed to development teams. it will remove lot of roadblocks on what to choose and how to code etc which we are seeing with lot of our POC. 
I don't have access to LangSmith or LangServe so couldn't try out those pieces. but was able to quickly use local lang serve option and run application.
looking forward to play more with this and may be convert one of my existing demos to use templates and make it working.
