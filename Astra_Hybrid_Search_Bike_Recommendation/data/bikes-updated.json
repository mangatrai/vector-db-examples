        "description": "Small and powerful, the Jigger is the best ride for the smallest of tikes! This is the tiniest kids’ pedal bike on the market available without a coaster brake, the Jigger is the vehicle of choice for the rare tenacious little rider raring to go. We say rare because this smokin’ little bike is not ideal for a nervous first-time rider, but it’s a true giddy up for a true speedster. The Jigger is a 12 inch lightweight kids bicycle and it will meet your little one’s need for speed. It’s a single speed bike that makes learning to pump pedals simple and intuitive. It even has  a handle in the bottom of the saddle so you can easily help your child during training!  The Jigger is among the most lightweight children’s bikes on the planet. It is designed so that 2-3 year-olds fit comfortably in a molded ride position that allows for efficient riding, balanced handling and agility. The Jigger’s frame design and gears work together so your buddingbiker can stand up out of the seat, stop rapidly, rip over trails and pump tracks. The Jigger’s is amazing on dirt or pavement. Your tike will speed down the bike path in no time. The Jigger will ship with a coaster brake. A freewheel kit is provided at no cost. "

        "description": "Kids want to ride with as little weight as possible. Especially on an incline! They may be at the age when a 27.5\" wheel bike is just too clumsy coming off a 24\" bike. The Hillcraft 26 is just the solution they need! Imagine 120mm travel. Boost front/rear.  You have NOTHING to tweak because it is easy to assemble right out of the box. The Hillcraft 26 is an efficient trail trekking machine. Up or down does not matter - dominate the trails going both down and up with this amazing bike. The name Monarch comes from Monarch trail in Colorado where we love to ride.  It’s a highly technical, steep and rocky trail but the rip on the waydown is so fulfilling.  Don’t ride the trail on a hardtail! It is so much more fun on the full suspension Hillcraft!  Hit your local trail with the Hillcraft Monarch 26 to get to where you want to go.  "
